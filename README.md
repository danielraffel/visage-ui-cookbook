# VisageÂ UIÂ CookbookÂ ðŸš€

Moderately fieldâ€‘tested tips for pairingÂ [Visage](https://github.com/VitalAudio/visage) â€” a lightweight, GPUâ€‘accelerated C++ UI framework â€” with audioâ€‘centric
toolkits such asÂ [JUCE](https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE) and AI coding assistants.

## Why Visage?

| You needâ€¦ | Visage gives youâ€¦ |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Retainedâ€‘mode GPU speed** in plugâ€‘ins | Crossâ€‘platform renderer (bgfx) |
| Deep control over **layout & animation** | `FlexFrame`, transforms, tweens |
| A clean way to **embed** inside JUCE windows | Single bridge helper |
| **Shaderâ€‘first effects** (blur, bloom, SDF) | Firstâ€‘class `PostEffect` API |

## Whatâ€™s in the cookbook?
